            <h3>About Tweekly.fm</h3>

            <p>This service provides users of Last.fm and Twitter (or Facebook) with the ability to post their Last.fm statistics automatically once per week or ad-hoc. We also provide you with a profile showing you how many other users share your taste in music. You can find new people to connect with and comment on their most listened to artists.</p>

            <p>If you would like to help us cover our running costs, please check out the donate page. Users will be provided with an ad-free experience if donating while logged in with a Twitter account.</p>

            <p>The original tweekly.fm service was created by Simon de la Rouviere and began life in January 2009. Towards the end of its initial year, it encountered a few problems. From January 2010, Scott Wilcox took over the development and running of the service - replacing the existing system with LastStatus.us version instead.</p>
